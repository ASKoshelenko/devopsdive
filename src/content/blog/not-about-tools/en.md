DevOps is not about the latest toolset. It's about mindset, ownership, and delivery. Tools are just the means.

I've seen teams chase the next big thing: Kubernetes, Terraform, Serverless, you name it. But without the right mindset, even the best tools become shelfware.

What matters?
• Taking ownership of problems, not just your code.
• Automating not for automation's sake, but to solve real pain points.
• Building bridges between dev and ops, not walls of blame.

I've worked in places where the toolchain was perfect, but the culture was toxic. Delivery suffered. People burned out. No tool can fix a broken process or a lack of trust.

The best DevOps engineers I know are not tool fanatics. They're problem solvers. They ask "why" before "how". They care about outcomes, not just outputs.

So next time you see a job ad listing 20 tools, remember: it's not about the stack. It's about the impact you make.

DevOps is a journey. Tools help, but mindset wins.
