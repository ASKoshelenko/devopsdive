DevOps can burn you out. Here's how I learned to survive, grow, and keep my passion alive.

Early in my career, I thought working 24/7 was the only way to succeed. I was wrong. Burnout hit me hard — and taught me lessons I'll never forget.

What helped me recover?
• Setting boundaries. Work is important, but so is life.
• Automating the boring stuff, so I could focus on what matters.
• Saying "no" to endless context switching and firefighting.
• Finding a community of like-minded engineers.

Now, I prioritize:
• Deep work over busywork.
• Learning over perfection.
• Health over hustle.

DevOps is a marathon, not a sprint. If you're feeling the pressure, you're not alone. Reach out, share your story, and remember: you can build great things without burning out.

Stay real. Stay balanced.
