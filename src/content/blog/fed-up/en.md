This is not a post for likes.
It's a post from the heart. For those who value real engineers over perfect resumes.

I've been in IT since 2016. Started as a system administrator. Did EVERYTHING: setup, monitoring, infrastructure maintenance. Alone. There wasn't even a fancy term like "DevOps" back then — but I was already living that mindset.

Then I moved into web development. Why not try? Built CRM systems, business tools, internal systems. Again — from scratch, no templates. Because real business problems don't follow templates.

Then came full-on DevOps. Cloud, automation, CI/CD, IaC…
Now? I'm running DevOps at Bosch. Leading the technical direction from the EPAM side. Azure, KQL, Helm, Terraform — all on me.

And what do I hear on the market?

"Weak AWS?"
"Your Kubernetes isn't at architect level?"
"Python? Not backend-grade?"

Are you serious? Do I need 10 years of experience in each tool to prove I can solve real problems?

⸻

What I actually deliver:
 • Built a full monitoring system in KQL for a live product
 • Integrated Azure OpenAI at Bosch — not for hype, but for solving team needs
 • Created a CRM for a pharmaceutical company — solo, no architect
 • Designed CI/CD pipelines that saved the team 70% of their time
 • Running and owning production infrastructure solo

But all I hear is:

"Your Python isn't backend enough"
"AWS not deep enough"
"Kubernetes not done from scratch"

Seriously?

⸻

My growth areas? I'll be honest:
 • Kubernetes: operational level, not architect-level (but you rarely need to build from scratch)
 • AWS: basic right now, working with Lambda and IAM though
 • Python: mostly scripting
 • Kafka: familiar, not used in production
 • ECS / API Gateway: seen, not built myself

⸻

English? B1+ officially, but I work in English daily.

I talk with teams from Germany, India, Portugal every day. They understand me. That's what matters.
I'm not doing stand-up comedy in English — I'm delivering working PoCs.

⸻

DevOps is NOT a checklist.

It's thinking.
It's responsibility.
It's delivery.
It's ME.
 • I don't just read about Helm — I write the charts
 • I don't study CI/CD — I build the pipelines
 • I don't "learn" KQL — I use it to monitor live prod
 • I don't dream of leadership — I lead, alone, in production

⸻

And let's be real for a second:

I'm a displaced person.
Lost my home. Backpack on my shoulders. Air raid sirens overhead.
But I have my skills. My brain. My will to move forward.

I'm not perfect. But I'm real.

And there are MANY like me. Not perfect. But real.
People who take responsibility, solve pain points, and aren't afraid to say:

"I don't know. But I'll figure it out."

Thank you to the recruiters and hiring managers who look beyond checkboxes.
Who see potential, not just buzzwords.
Who can spot a diamond, even if it doesn't shine with a certificate (yet).

So...
Who am I?
