# DevSecOps Pipeline Implementation

## Project Overview

### Situation
- Organization faced security and deployment challenges:
  - Manual security checks slowing down deployments
  - Inconsistent security practices across teams
  - Limited visibility into security vulnerabilities
  - Complex compliance requirements
  - Slow response to security incidents
  - Growing number of security tools to manage

```

### Task
Implement comprehensive DevSecOps solution:
- Integrate security tools into CI/CD pipelines
- Automate security scanning and compliance checks
- Establish consistent security practices
- Enable real-time vulnerability detection
- Implement automated remediation workflows
- Ensure compliance with industry standards

### Action

#### 1. Architecture Design

    subgraph "Source Control"
    A[Git Repository] --> B[Pull Request]
    end
    
    subgraph "CI/CD Pipeline"
    B --> C[Build Stage]
    C --> D[Security Scan]
    D --> E[Compliance Check]
    E --> F[Deployment]
    end
